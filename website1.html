<p>
Back to the street where we began<br />
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know<br />
Yeah we're feeling so good<br /><br />

Pickin up things we shouldnt read<br />
It looks like the end of history as we know<br />
Its just the end of the world<br /><br />

Back to the street where we began<br />
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can<br /><br />

Into a place where thoughts can bloom<br />
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon<br />
And we know that it could be<br />
And we know that it should<br />
And you know that you feel it too<br />
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon<br /><br />

And your eyes are the size of the moon<br />
You could 'cause you can so you do<br />
We're feeling so good<br />
just the way that we do<br />
When it's nine in the afternoon<br /><br />

Your eyes are the size of the moon<br />
You could 'cause you can so you do<br />
We're feeling so good<br /><br />

Back to the street<br />
Down to our feet<br />
Losing the feeling of feeling unique<br />
Do you know what I mean?<br /><br />

Back to the place<br />
Where we used to say<br />
Man it feels good to feel this way<br />
Now I know what I mean<br /><br />

Back to the street, back to the place,<br />
Back to the room where it all began, hey<br />
Back to the room where it all began<br />
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon<br /><br />

Your eyes are the size of the moon<br />
You could 'cause you can so you do<br />
We're feeling so good<br />
Just the way that we do<br />
When it's nine in the afternoon<br />
[x3]<br />
